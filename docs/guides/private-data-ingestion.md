# Private Data Ingestion

PBI can ingest private sources from `private_data/` in addition to public PhageScope data.

## Required per source

```text
private_data/
  <Source_DB>/
    metadata.csv
    phage.fasta
    hosts/
      <Host_ID>.fna
```

## Mandatory rules

- `metadata.csv` is required
- `phage.fasta` is required
- host sequences are required as `hosts/<Host_ID>.fna`
- every `Host_ID` in metadata must map to a host FASTA file
- every `Phage_ID` in metadata must exist in `phage.fasta`

## Validate before pipeline

```bash
pbi validate-private
```

## Runtime behavior

- Valid private sources are ingested and linked with `source_type=private`
- Invalid sources are skipped (public pipeline still completes)
- Re-running pipeline synchronizes removals/additions
- `Source_DB` in `metadata.csv` must match the source folder name exactly

## Validate what was ingested

Use DuckDB (or `SequenceRetriever`) to inspect available source labels:

```sql
SELECT Source_DB, source_type, COUNT(*) AS phage_count
FROM fact_phages
GROUP BY Source_DB, source_type
ORDER BY source_type, Source_DB;
```

If you filter `Source_DB = 'test_private'` and get `0`, first check this query to confirm the exact source name currently present (for example `test_private_2`).

## Output mappings

- `private_phage_mapping.json` routes private phage retrieval
- `host_fasta_mapping.json` includes host paths (public + private)

## Logs

In Docker runs, logs/reports are available in `./pipeline_logs/`.

Private-source validation details are written to:

- `private_data/private_manifest.json` (host path)
- `/private-data/private_manifest.json` (inside container)

This manifest explicitly lists:

- `is_valid` per source
- validation `errors`
- skipped/ingested source counts
