# Welcome to PBI-Scope Documentation

**PBI-Scope — Phage Bacteria Interactions (v0.4.0)**

## What is PBI-Scope?

PBI-Scope is a reproducible Docker-first pipeline that prepares phage-host data for analysis and machine learning.

It combines:

1. **Public phage data** from [PhageScope](https://phagescope.deepomics.org/) (which itself aggregates multiple phage sources)
2. **Optional private datasets** from `private_data/`
3. **Host genome resolution/download** from NCBI RefSeq

Outputs are stored in a shared data volume and consumed through the `pbi` Python package or the REST API.

!!! info "Database overview and data sample available here: "
    For a quick visual overview of all PhageScope tables and data quality, see the [Database Validation Report](reports/database_validation.html) and [Phage Metadata Report](reports/phage_metadata_report.html).

> PBI-Scope is **not PhageScope-only** anymore. Private source ingestion is part of the standard workflow when source folders are present.

## Quick Start Examples

### Using the `pbi` package (recommended for notebooks)

```python
from pbi import quick_connect

# Connect to the database
retriever = quick_connect()

# Get statistics
stats = retriever.get_stats()
print(f"Phages: {stats['database']['phages']:,}")

# Query phage metadata
phages = retriever.get_phage_metadata(limit=10)
print(phages[['Phage_ID', 'Source_DB', 'Length']].head())
```

### Using the API client (recommended for quick exploration)

```python
from pbi import APIClient

# Connect to the API (start with: docker compose up api)
client = APIClient("http://localhost:8000")

# Get database stats
stats = client.get_stats()
print(f"Phages: {stats['database']['phages']:,}")

# Query with filter
refseq = client.get_phage_metadata(
    where_clause="Source_DB = 'RefSeq' AND Length > 50000",
    limit=10
)
print(refseq.head())
```

## Work in Progress

!!! warning "Host prediction bias"
    Most host assignments in PhageScope are **predicted by [DeepHost](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/23/1/bbab385/6374063)**, not experimentally validated. This introduces a significant bias: if you build a host prediction model using this data, you are training on already-predicted labels rather than curated ground truth.

    We are in communication with the DeepHost authors to address this issue and improve host assignment quality in future releases.
